# Wordle Project

This is a fun little project where I attempted to recreate wordle. Created this after 
learning python in my 3rd year of college and partially completed within a couple days. 
This was revived the very next year as an addition to a event that happened at my university.

## Summary:
* Highlights correct, misplaced, and incorrect letters.
* Word list from a [wordle dictionary](https://wordunscrambler.me/wordle-words-list) found online.
* Simple UI recreated through tkinter library.
* Simple game loop for endless fun!

Feel free to clone this project and mangle with it however you like!
